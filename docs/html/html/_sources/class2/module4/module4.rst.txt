Module 4: Setup a Service scaling group (SSG) in AWS
====================================================

.. note:: On this page there is no actions to be done here regarding the lab itself


In this module, we will learn about the ``Service Scaling Group`` (SSG) feature
provided with BIG-IQ 6.0 in a the ``AWS`` environment.

The ``Service Scaling Group`` (SSG) gives us the capability to setup a cluster of BIG-IPs
that will scale based on criterias defined by the administrator.

Topology of Service Scaling Group
*********************************

With BIG-IQ 6.0, the ``Service Scaling Group`` is composed of 2 tiers of ADCs.
Depending on the environment, the implementation of the ``Service Scaling Group``
(SSG) will differ.

============= ===================================== ============================
 Environment     Tier1 (called ``Service Scaler``)      Tier2 (called ``SSG``)
============= ===================================== ============================
   AWS                       ELB                                 F5 VE
   VMWARE                   F5 ADC                               F5 VE
============= ===================================== ============================

Tier1/``Service Scaler`` management - how does this work ?
**********************************************************

With BIG-IQ 6.0, the provisioning and deployment of Tier1 has to be done
upfront by the administrator. It means that:


* The F5 platform (or AWS ELB) will have to be provisioned, licensed (for F5 VE)
  and its networking configuration done
* Once the platform is ready. everything related to app deployment will be
  handled by BIG-IQ


.. note::

  With BIG-IQ 6.0, we only support F5 Virtual edition as ``Service Scaler`` in
  a VMWare env.
  With BIG-IQ 6.0.1, we will support F5 HW also


Tier2/``SSG`` management - how does this work ?
***********************************************

With BIG-IQ 6.0, the provisioning of ``SSG`` BIG-IPs is fully automated. You
don't have to setup anything upfront but licenses for BIG-IQ to assign to the
dynamically provisioned BIG-IPs

To handle the provisioning and onboarding of our F5 virtual edition, we leverage
different components:

* ansible playbooks to handle the provisioning of our F5 virtual edition
* our F5 cloud deployment templates

  * `F5 AWS template <https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-aws-cloudformation>`_
  * `F5 VMWare template <https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-vmware-vcenter-templates>`_

* f5 cloud libs

  * `F5 cloud libs <https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-cloud-libs>`_

.. note:: We will review this in more details in lab4

Application deployment in a ``SSG`` - AWS
*****************************************

To ensure the traffic goes through the ``SSG`` as expected, application will be
deployed in a certain manner:

* You will need dedicated ``Classic Load Balancer`` (AKA ELB previously) per
  application. The reason is that each ``ELB`` has one public IP/DNS Name
  (ie you can't have 2 app runnings on port 443/HTTPS on a ``ELB`` )
* When the app is deployed from BIG-IQ, we will specify a VS IP that will be 0.0.0.0.
  This is because ELB can only send traffic to the first nic of an instance and
  therefore we will deploy 1nic VE in AWS. So traffic and everything will be sent
  to the nic Self IP.
* This config will be configured on all ``SSG`` VEs.
  They will have have an **identical** Setup

In this lab, we will create a ``Service Scaling Group`` in an ``AWS`` environment.
