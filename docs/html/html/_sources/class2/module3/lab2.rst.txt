Lab 3.2: Upgrade and scale-up our SSG
-------------------------------------

In the previous lab, we have updated our ``Cloud Environment``. We can now replace 
the instances running in our ``SSG`` **SSGClass2**. 

In the ``BIG-IQ`` UI, go to *Applications* > *Environments* > *Service Scaling Groups* and 
click on your ``SSG`` **SSGClass2**.

Click on the *Configuration* tab, and then *Devices*. This is where you can review 
the ``SSG`` devices that has been deployed.

.. warning:: we recommend to change one device at a time for such process

Select the device called **SSGClass2-1.f5demo.local** and click on the *Replace* button.

As soon as you do this, you'll trigger the replacement of this device by another using 
our updated *Cloud Environment*. You'll see a yellow alert at the top that will look like 
this

.. note:: the replacement process is not restricted by the *Maximum Devices(s) Required* 
    limit you have defined in your ``SSG``. It you were already at the maximum capacity of your 
    ``SSG`` the replacement would still happen

You can monitor the deployment of the new instance : 


* via the log files *orchestrator.log* and *restjavad.0.log* on ``BIG-IQ``

* via the alerts available in the ``BIG-IQ`` UI
* monitor the vCenter interface (here you can also check that it has 4 vCPUs instead of 2)

After some time, you'll see the new device being discovered by ``BIG-IQ``: 

.. image:: ../pictures/module3/img_module3_lab2_5.png
 :align: center
 :scale: 50%

|

.. note:: During this process, you're still able to deploy applications on top of this 
    ``SSG``

The device will be fully discovered:

 :align: center
 :scale: 50%

|

Here ``BIG-IQ`` will push the applications on this ``SSG`` device. Once it's done, it will 
remove the device **SSGClass2-1.f5demo.local** and the yellow banner at the top will 
disappear

This is the process to do on each device that needs to be replaced. We would need to repeat 
this task on **SSGClass2-2.f5demo.local** to finalize our upgrade/scale-up of our ``SSG``. 
This won't be needed for this lab. 

As you have seen, the upgrade and scale-up process are identical and can be done at the 
same time if needed
